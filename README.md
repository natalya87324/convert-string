## The aim
The aim is to put to practice a function that takes in a string and returns the string with the first letter of each word capitalized. The assumption is that each word consists of only letters and spaces. 
I have applied this functionality at my current job - it helps me automatically convert any full names to the normalized format. It makes my working process faster and more accurate.

## Additional features to work on:
- add a functionality that will delete the entered text
- make the interface more user-friendly
